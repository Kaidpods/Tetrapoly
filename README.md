   - Add sound effects (e.g., dice rolling, property trading) to make the game more engaging.

4. **Save and Load Game State**:
   - Implement a save/load feature so that players can continue their game later.
   - Save player progress, property ownership, and other relevant data.

5. **Improved UI/UX**:
